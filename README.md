# Go Programming Language Book Examples

This repository contains my code examples and exercises from the book "The Go Programming Language" by Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan.

## Organization

- Each chapter/major example might have its own subdirectory (e.g., /chapter1, /image-server)

## Usage

- **Prerequisites:**
  - Go (version 1.x or later) installed and configured
- **To run a specific example:**
  1.  Navigate to the example's directory.
  2.  Use `go build` to compile (if needed).
  3.  Run the resulting executable.
